# About this extension
Auto Save HTML is a small extension which can be used to automatically download the HTML document(s) of a specified website when browsing that same website.

## HOW TO USE
1. Install the extension
2. Click on menu (3-stripes) button -> Add-ons -> Extensions
3. Click the ellipsis (3-dot) menu and then Options (Windows) or Preferences (macOS/Linux)
4. Add target sites (use a [match pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Match_patterns))
5. Navigate to the target sites. The extension will dump HTML files from a target site into the browser's Downloads folder as AutoSave_{TIMESTAMP}.htm

This extension is inspired by [Auto Save Document](http://web.archive.org/web/20171031233032/https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/auto-save-document/) and the development motivated by the Auto Save Document's non-compatibility with Firefox Quantum.
