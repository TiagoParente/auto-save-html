# About this extension
Auto Save HTML is a small extension which can be used to automatically download the HTML document(s) of a specified website when browsing that same website.

## HOW TO USE
1. Install the extension
2. Go to Tools -> Add-ons -> Extensions and click the Options (Windows) or Preferences (macOS/Linux) button from Auto Save HTML
3. Set the target site (use a [match pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Match_patterns)) and click the Save button
4. Navigate to the target site. The extension will dump HTML files from the target site into the browser's Downloads folder as AutoSave_{TIMESTAMP}.htm

This extension is inspired by [Auto Save Document](http://legacycollector.org/firefox-addons/2704/index.html) and the development motivated by the Auto Save Document's non-compatibility with Firefox Quantum.
